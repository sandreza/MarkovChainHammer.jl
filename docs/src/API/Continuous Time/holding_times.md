# [Holding Times](@id sec:holding_times)

In the previous section we introduced the generator, but we did not delve into details about it's properties. In this section we will see how the generator can be used to compute the [holding times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain) of a Markov chain. The holding time of a Markov chain is the time spent in a particular state. The holding time of a Markov chain is a random variable and the distribution of the holding time is given by the generator.
