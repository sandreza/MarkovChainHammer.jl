# MarkovChainHammer.jl

Documentation for [MarkovChainHammer.jl](https://github.com/sandreza/MarkovChainHammer.jl). There are several conventions in use throughout the repository: 

0. All transfer operators are represented as column stochastic matrices
0. The columns of the generator sum to zero
0. All markov chains are vectors of integers from 1 to n, where n is the number of states in the markov chain

For an overview of Markov chains and their use with the present package, see the [Markov Chain](@ref sec:markov_chains) section. This section contains a review of Markov chains and how to use some of the basic functionality of the repository.

For further details on each module within the repository see the [Module Overview](@ref sec:module_overview) section. 

And for a more detailed explanation of the functions within each module, see the [Function Index](@ref sec:function_index) section.
