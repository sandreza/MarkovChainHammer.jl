# MarkovChainHammer.jl

Documentation for [MarkovChainHammer.jl](https://github.com/sandreza/MarkovChainHammer.jl). There are several conventions in use throughout the repository: 

0. All transfer operators are represented as column stochastic matrices
0. The columns of the generator sum to zero
0. All markov chains are vectors of integers from 1 to n, where n is the number of states in the markov chain
