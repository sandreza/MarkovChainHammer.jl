# [Clustering](@id sec:clustering)

In a community detection problem the goal is to find *communities* from network information. In this case we don't have an adjacency matrix, but rather a transfer operator. Thus connections between vertices are not just given by 0's and 1's, but rather by a continuum of numbers in between.
